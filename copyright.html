  <H2>Abstract</H2>

  This article investigates how the Internet will impact on traditional
  and emerging businesses that rely on control of copyright restrictions.
  Such restrictions are a critical part of the business 
  models used by the distributors of intellectual work, such as media empires. 
  However, because this is so critical, it exposes a weakness that is
  particularly exploitable on the Internet, since copying can be
  easily carried out and copyright cannot be restricted.
  <P>

  In looking at how this weakness has arisen, this article discusses how 
  some businesses on the Internet manage to avoid it. Examples from the 
  worlds 
  of MP3, shareware, and Open Source are investigated, providing insights 
  into how a 
  business can be `Internet-proof'. The basic method for achieving this is 
  to adopt one of several business models which do not rely on charging for 
  easily copyable products.
  <P>

  The two classes of model are the `Exploit the Opportunity' and
  `Exploit the Relationship' models. For each of these models, a
  business vulnerable to exploitation of the
  copyright weakness is sited, and reworked as an example.
  Media-based businesses must follow such models or face 
  losing revenue to businesses that are run illegally, or overseas
  where copyright restrictions simply cannot be enforced.

  <H2><A NAME="introduction">Introduction</A></H2>

  This article is written for people who are in an
  industry that involves `intellectual products'. The distribution
  of such products is governed by copyright, and in fact businesses
  that are based on this distribution now depend on copyright.
  <P>

  Such businesses have been around for years, but now the landscape in
  which these businesses operate has changed. As we will see, this change
  will have quite drastic implications for traditional businesses, who
  may have to develop entirely new business models in order to cope. The
  change is the spread of modern technology.
  <P>

  There are two particular aspects of modern technology that concern
  us in this article. The first is the widespread use of technologies
  that allow intellectual products to be copied. The other is the
  world-wide growth of the Internet. As a result of the spread of these
  technologies, modern culture has changed, and now readily accepts
  the practise of copying, and retrieval of copies from anywhere
  in the world.
  <P>

  In the following section,
<A HREF="copyright.html#copyright">Copyright</A>,
  we will see how businesses have pushed the boundaries of copyright as
  they have become more global, but how copyright is not enough to
  completely control the copying of intellectual products in a
  global arena. The section on
<A HREF="copyright.html#motivations">Motivations</A>
  looks at the extent to which people copy products, and why they
  do so.
  In
<A HREF="copyright.html#products_and_services">Products and Services</A>,
  we will see descriptions of typical businesses in the intellectual
  products industry, and see how the different components of their
  business models based on control of copyright.
  <P>

  The section on
<A HREF="copyright.html#internet_distribution">Internet Distribution</A>
  examines how businesses on the Internet are faced with problem
  of widespread copying. Several of them are coping well despite this,
  and we examine them in the section on
<A HREF="copyright.html#internet_models">Internet Models</A>.
  These examples suggest two main business models that resist the
  traditional weakness of dependence on copyright, and these are
  examined in
<A HREF="copyright.html#exploit_the_opportunity">Exploit the Opportunity</A>
  and
<A HREF="copyright.html#exploit_the_relationship">Exploit the Relationship</A>.
  Finally, we draw the various threads of the argument together and 
  state the
<A HREF="copyright.html#conclusions">Conclusions</A>
  that follow from our analysis.

  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <H2><A NAME="copyright">Copyright</A></H2>

  In order to see how control of copyright has become essential to 
  the running of certain businesses, firstly we need to see exactly 
  what it is, and how it has evolved.
  <P>

  Copyright is the legal restriction on making copies of intellectual 
  works, such as books, films, software, and music. Control over copyright is 
  usually automatically given to the author of an intellectual 
  work, but may be sold to other entities, such as publishers, in return 
  for money or the privilege of having the work published. It is only 
  one of many legal mechanisms for protecting intellectual works, 
  other common ones are trademarks and patents. Its advantages are that 
  it is pretty much applicable world-wide, is automatically 
  bestowed, allows for `fair use', and accepts the occurrence of 
  independent invention. One of its chief purposes is to encourage 
  creativity, by giving authors the opportunity to exploit their own work.
  <P>

  The media-based industry obviously benefits also from the existance of
  copyright. With businesses based on material that can be copied,
  copyright laws that restrict the ability of their competitors from
  duplicating that material are welcomed by the industry. We shall see
  how such businesses have come to rely on these copyright restrictions.
  <P>

  The software industry has its own particular slant on copyright,
  which is particularly interesting since it is the only form of work
  that was created into an electronic world. When software is installed
  and run, many copies of different parts of it are created. When
  copyright was invented, such a self-copying creature was never
  imagined. Hence, software is
  distributed with a license to make more copies of it, for the purpose
  of running it. It still isn't clear exactly how legally binding a
  software licence is. It is more complex than the idea of copyright, as
  it gives additional rights to the providers of the software. However,
  we can think of a licence as a particular variant of copyright.
  <P>

  We have had copyright for quite some time now, although its exact 
  implementation has changed over the years. In Britain,
<A HREF="http://www.scu.edu.au/sponsored/ausweb/ausweb95/papers/future/lean/">copyright appeared</A>
  in 1709 soon after the printing press, primarily as a censorship 
  strategy. In the United States, the
<A HREF="http://www.public.asu.edu/~dkarjala/">first copyright</A>
  act dates from 1790, when copyright applied for a maximum of 28 years. 
  <P>

  The Berne Convention is a
<A HREF="http://www.wipo.org/eng/iplex/wo_ber0_.htm">global agreement</A>
  on copyright between most modern nations, and provides the form of our 
  present copyright system. It was formed in September 1886, although 
  notably the United States 
<A HREF="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/fls/fl100.htm">didn't join</A>
  until March 1989.
  <P>
  
  This was not the United States' first involvement in 
  world copyright, and it has
<A HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/Intellectual_property/ucc.paper">been part</A>
  of the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC) since September 1955. The 
  main difference between the UCC form of copyright and that of the Berne 
  Convention is that under the UCC, copyright is not automatic.
  <P>

  This slow march to global copyright laws is paralleled by the steady 
  globalisation of media-based industry.
  This globalisation can be charted by the 
  steady advance in broadcast technologies, although the industry also 
  encompasses other media, such as film and print. In 1923, the UK firm 
  Reuters began for the first time to 
<A HREF="http://www.reuters.com/aboutreuters/background/history.htm">transmit news</A>
  stories internationally, using radio. In the late 1930s, regular, 
  broadcast, black and white television  
<A HREF="http://www.oldradio.com/current/bc_tv.htm">appeared</A>.
  In the 60s, colour television broadcasting began, and this 
  present decade has ushered in digital TV broadcasts.
  <P>

  We now live in a world dominated by media that is controlled by a small 
  number of large players. These include 
<A HREF="http://disney.go.com/International.html">Disney</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.pathfinder.com/corp/index.html">Time-Warner</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.newscorp.com/">News Corp</A>, 
  and Microsoft (who for our purposes we can consider a 
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/">media empire</A>).
  Global players such as these rely on global copyright laws for their 
  business to continue. In almost every case, the copyright of 
  intellectual product distributed by these companies is owned by 
  these companies.
  <P>

  Authors of film, music, writings, and software have a hard time 
  distributing their products globally themselves using conventional 
  distribution channels. The easiest way to get your work into 
  circulation is to sell the copyright to a big player and let them 
  do the distribution. Sometimes you will get a small fraction of the 
  royalties, often you will get a once-off payment, it depends on the 
  agreement you can come to with the publisher. The profits from sales 
  of these works go almost wholly to the big player, for which copyright 
  is critical to ensure continued sales.
  <P>

  Additionally, it is understandable that copyright and many other legal
  devices can 
  be used to best advantage by a large company. Individual authors would 
  find it 
  very hard to hunt down and prosecute violators of their copyright, 
  especially as in general they wouldn't have enough money to take them 
  all through court. An individual author might use the services of a
  larger body, such as 
<A HREF="http://www.apra.com.au">APRA</A>
  in Australia, to police usage and
  collect revenue. The disadvantages to the author in this case are
  that they may have to agree to the fee collection policies used by 
  that body, they must trust the body to police their rights properly,
  and by retaining their copyright, they may not be able to easily 
  use the traditional
  distribution networks operated by the media industry.
  <P>

  Microsoft and the large software companies use 
  the services of organisations such as the 
<A HREF="http://www.bsa.org">Business Software Alliance</A>
  (BSA) to protect their profits through enforcement of copyright 
  restrictions. In fact, it has 
<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/news/business/story/9348.html">been reported</A>
  that after the BSA discovered certain copyright violations, copyright 
  lawsuits were not pursued when the violators signed software 
  licences with Microsoft exclusively.
  <P>

  So important is copyright to the business of international media empires 
  that they have recently 
<A HREF="http://www.public.asu.edu/~dkarjala/legmats/1998Statement.html">pushed for</A>,
  and gained, an increase in the term of copyright in both Europe and the US.
  As a result, the copyright term in the US is now 95 years after the 
  creator's death, and correspondingly 70 years in Europe. 
  (One humanitarian and apt exception is the 
<A HREF="http://www.anglia.ac.uk/~systimk/Articles/Peter-Pan2.Html">perpetual copyright</A>
  bestowed on the childrens' story Peter Pan. An act of parliament in 
  Britain ensures that royalties will always continue to flow to the 
  Great Ormond Street (London) Hospital for Sick Children.)
  <P>

  The length of the copyright term has been steadily increased, presumably 
  due to 
  pressure from the global media community, as this most recent increase 
  has been. This community, and the publishers within it, must be highly
  dependent on copyright in order to motivate such relentless pressure. 
  The trouble for publishers is that copyright is reliant
  on the particular local laws, and always runs out (except in the 
  individual case of Peter Pan). As soon as a valuable intellectual work
  enters a country with lax copyright laws, or the copyright term runs 
  out, control over that work is lost. 
  Assuming 
  that the copyright term will not be continually extended, copyright is 
  never going to be completely adequate for the needs of the media empires.
  <P>

  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <H2><A NAME="motivations">Motivations</A></H2>

  Copyright aims to prevent works being copied. But copies are still 
  likely to be made of a work when the perceived benefit of making a copy is 
  greater than the penalty of the fine, taking into account the risk of 
  being caught. In fact, in our culture, the copying of copyrighted works
  is almost a mundane occurrence. We shall investigate why this
  might be so.
  <P>

  Let's look at a couple of intellectual objects, and start by considering 
  the 
  benefits and disadvantages of someone copying information about the 
  price of a certain stock that I own. Knowing the most recent
  information about the stock's price is of high value to me, and as the
  information becomes older and older, the value decreases. Knowing the
  price of the stock as of last week is of no real value to me. In fact,
  US stock information delayed between 15 and 20 minutes is 
<A HREF="http://www.nasdaq.com/">available</A>
  for free on the Internet. If someone gained access to recent stock
  information, then because it would be valuable to me, they might sell
  it to me. Hence making a copy of the information is beneficial to 
  them. But copying may cause them to be disadvantaged if they take 
  too long performing the copying, as the
  information will become worthless, and they will have wasted their time.
  <P>

  The lesson from copying time critical information, such as stock
  price information, is that there is
  only a small window of opportunity in which the copying can be
  benefited from. This makes it hard to benefit from, although the
  benefits may be quite high due to the exclusive nature of the
  information.
  <P>

  A compact disc is a more tangible intellectual object. I listened
  to a CD last night and enjoyed it. However, I could have listened 
  to any particular format of it and still received the same enjoyment. 
  If I'd had a copy of the CD on cassette, and I couldn't find the CD,
  then I would've listened to the cassette instead, being only slightly 
  disadvantaged by the lower sound quality. Having a `backup' copy
  ensures that my investment in the CD is preserved.
  <P>

  The disadvantage of getting a backup copy is that one needs to be
  bought, or copied onto a blank one. Preserving the backup copy
  requires a possibly long-term commitment. Making the copy will 
  always have some cost associated with it, and it may never be
  required. The risk of being caught violating copyright restrictions
  in this way is very low. Hence dubbing is quite a common activity.
  Alternatively, the copy might be sold or given away. This is
  considerably more risky, but no more expensive. The benefit here is
  that there will be an incentive to sell the copy. 
  <P>

  Interestingly, the current generation of people in western nations 
  has integrated the act of copying into the culture. The spread of 
  technology has not just benefited media empires, and today we have 
  access to photocopiers, VCRs, integrated CD/cassette decks, fax 
  machines, computers, scanners, CD-R drives, music samplers, and 
  other devices that allow people to create illegal copies of 
  intellectual work very easily.
  <P>

  Primarily, it is this ease that has allowed copying to become part of the 
  culture, despite any legal objections that there might be. The 
  practises of creating `party tapes' from existing music collections,
  recording programmes from TV for later viewing, photocopying newspaper 
  articles to give to friends, or wearing fake designer watches and 
  clothing are extremely widespread. Some people have 
<A HREF="http://www.swin.edu.au/ssb/media/alm310/projects/baden/pg7.htm">drawn</A>
  this behaviour into the philosophical ideas of post-modernism, which is 
  not something I wish to discuss here due to its contentious nature, 
  although it is 
  worth a mention. People make copies of things every day 
  and think nothing of it. The value to them of having a copy is enough
  to outweigh the risk of a fine, and so copying has <I>become habit</I>.
  <P>

  An OECD report on international software trade
<A HREF="http://www.oecd.org//dsti/sti/it/ec/prod/sw-trade.pdf">reports</A>
  that pirating of software has become endemic in some countries. Some
  examples of figures from the report are that in 1996, 27% of software
  installed in the US were illegal copies. Similarly, 41% of software in
  Japan, and 34% of software in the UK were illegal copies. From this it
  is clear that in western nations, around a third of people would 
  copy software if they thought they could get away with it. In most other
  nations, these figures are much higher.
  <P>

  People are told not to make copies of intellectual works, and not 
  just because making copies is illegal. The usual argument against 
  copying is the same as the argument for copyright: copying removes the 
  incentives for people to produce the works in the first place, so in 
  the long term we all suffer from the works not being made. This gives 
  us a moral reason (as well as the legal reason) for why people should 
  not make their own copies, but is it a compelling reason?
  <P>
  There are three straightforward objections to this reasoning:
  <OL>
    <LI>This is an argument to a group, and not an individual. It
        doesn't explain why some person in particular shouldn't make
        copies.</LI>
    <LI>Sometimes copying doesn't prevent the creator receiving
        incentive, and actually gives them more incentive.</LI>
    <LI>Other perfectly legal actions are just as likely to
        prevent the creator receiving incentive, but we think
        that those actions are acceptable.</LI>
  </OL>
  Let's look at these in turn.
  <P>

  In social psychology, it is 
<A HREF="http://www.vcu.edu/hasweb/psy/faculty/fors/ratt.html">well known</A>
  that within a group, there is a diffusion of responsibility. This
  means that any argument that is put to a group will be diluted because
  the members of the group do not always feel personally responsible
  for the conclusions. In our case, we are examining an argument 
  of the form "we should all respect copyright, otherwise we will all
  eventually suffer". However, if we don't <I>all</I> respect copyright,
  and instead only 99% of people do, then that 1% of people will not
  actually suffer. These 1% are parasites on the rest of the system,
  but the argument cannot persuade someone to be in the 99% rather
  than the 1%, since it is actually a disadvantage for them to be so.
  The parasites get the benefit of copies as well as the benefit of
  continued innovation.
  <P>

  The second objection given was that there are examples of when
  the opposite of the claim in the argument is apparently true. For
  example, in the world of music, the band The Grateful Dead credit the
<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/mpthree/story/17796.html">bootleg industry</A>
  created by their fans as one of the factors enabling them to become 
  one of the highest grossing acts in history. In the world of software,
  the concept of shareware is that a potential user can try the software
  before they pay for it. Shareware creators encourage users to create
  copies and give them to their friends and workmates, since each
  recipient of a copy is a new potential user. In both The Grateful Dead
  and shareware examples, copying of the work increases the incentive
  that the creators receive.
  <P>

  The third objection was that other legal activities are as likely to
  prevent the creator receiving incentive, but we allow them, and people
  continue to create new works. These are activities where after one
  person purchases the work, multiple people then proceed to benefit
  from that work without any more money going to the creator (or their
  publisher). Hiring, borrowing, and buying something second-hand are
  all legal examples of this type of activity. In fact, as with the
  examples of bands and shareware above, often the creator does benefit
  from these activities in the form of increased publicity and exposure.
  Exposure then translates into money from follow-up business 
  and increased demand for the work.
  <P>

  We can draw some conclusions from all of this. Firstly, copying 
  is often beneficial to the people who do it, mostly because the risk 
  of being caught is small and the reward is high. Secondly, due to the
  increasing availability of copy technologies, copying has become a
  common part of our culture. Thirdly, the argument that people should
  respect copyright because it encourages new work is not strong enough
  to be convincing. From this, it is apparent that people are being
  raised in today's culture are going to expect to be able to continue
  their habits of copying. In fact, this practise is likely to become
  even more common.
  <P>

  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <H2><A NAME="products_and_services">Products and Services</A></H2>

  There are two main categories of business that relate to intellectual
  works, such as books, CDs, software, and films.  These are 
  businesses that are involved in selling products, and businesses 
  that sell services. The obvious question is: what is the essential
  difference between a product and a service? Simply put, a product 
  is something that can be given away, but a
  service is something that can be taken away.
  <P>

  Control over the continued possession of a <I>service</I>
  is
  in the hands of the provider, while control over the continued
  possession of a
  <I>product</I> is in the hands of the receiver. This is because while the
  receiver can deprive the recipient of a service, once the recipient
  gets their hands on the product, the provider cannot ever be sure of
  depriving them of it.
  To make it a totally clear, let's look at some examples of products 
  and services in the world of intellectual works. 
  <P>

  A radio station provides the listeners with a service: the listeners 
  are provided with recent music by good, or well-known artists, and 
  commentary by amusing disk-jockeys. Of course, some stations provide 
  more or less than this, but this is usually the essence of it. A radio 
  station also provides a service to advertising agencies or community 
  groups, allowing messages from them to be broadcast to the station's 
  audience. These are both services, as the radio station could stop them 
  at any time.
  <P>

  A bookstore provides products and services. Book buyers are provided 
  with the service of having a collection of easily browsable publications 
  in a single place. A store also retails a product which is something 
  that can be taken away and read on the loo, or curled up in bed, or 
  wherever you like to read. Interestingly, I suspect that the majority 
  of a store's day-to-day expenses are involved in providing the 
  service (staff wages, leasing shop-front, etc.) while all of the 
  income is from sales of the product. Once again, the service is 
  something that the store can do away with at any time, but the product 
  is yours to read however and whenever you like.
  <P>

  A software publisher provides products and services as well. The
  product is the software that you run on 
  your computer to entertain you
  or increase your productivity. The service is writing this software to
  meet your requirements, in enough time for you to use it. Sometimes
  the service is predicting your requirements so that the software is
  there when you need it. There are often follow-up services such as
  providing you with support once you start using the software, and 
  modifying it as your needs change.
  <P>

  A newspaper publisher resembles an interesting mix of the services of the 
  radio station and product of the bookstore. One service the newspaper 
  provides 
  is to make an up-to-date product available to you and to many other 
  people that you know. The product is, of course, the newspaper itself. 
  As an 
  aside, newspapers never used to provide up-to-date news. In the 
  pre-telegraph era, news would slowly disperse from newspaper to 
  newspaper across the country, and could be many months old by the 
  time you read it. However, these days most people wouldn't bother to 
  read a month old newspaper. The product is not so important to them, 
  but the service is.
  <P>

  In a couple of these examples, the service and the product were tightly 
  bound, for example the service consisted of distributing the product. 
  In Geoffrey Moore's book
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887307175/">Crossing The Chasm</A>,
  the term "the whole product" is used to describe this conglomeration
  of services together with a product. Without a whole product to buy,
  consumers are unlikely to commit themselves to a purchase.
  <P>

  In these cases the business model is often to charge for the 
  product, and not for the service. This is often because it is easier 
  to charge for the product than for the service: customers understand 
  the policy of paying for a product; the flow of the product can be 
  easily regulated to ensure that only paying customers receive the 
  associated service. So why is this process so product-focussed?
  <P>

  Copyright comes in once again. Copyright restrictions are used to 
  ensure that other people or organisations cannot distribute the same 
  product. As long as the only way that the product can be received is 
  via the service that is provided, then it is only necessary to regulate 
  the product to regulate the service. Control of the copyright and 
  control of the service go hand in hand to ensure that a premium
  can be charged for the product.
  <P>

  This once again indicates how much the media empires rely on the 
  restriction of copyright to maintain their business. Without copyright 
  restrictions, anyone could distribute the product through a competing 
  service. In this case, as no income is being received by the business 
  through sales of product, the service is no longer viable. The use 
  of copyright in this way ensures a `monopoly' over the product, 
  controlling supply, hence increasing demand, and meaning that 
  people are willing to pay for 
  it, to get the service as well.
  <P>

  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <H2><A NAME="internet_distribution">Internet Distribution</A></H2>

  Academia has a history of being rather lax when it comes to 
  respecting copyright. It is common to photocopy large numbers of 
  articles and claim fair use, although my experience is that often 
  this would not be legally justified. Also, in publishing a paper, 
  the copyright is sold to the publisher, but often the writer or 
  writers continue to give out copies of it. This atmosphere of 
  sharing knowledge for the good of the discipline has probably had a 
  very positive effect on research overall, and this is 
<A HREF="https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/what-internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet">the atmosphere</A>
  that the Internet was born into.
  <P>

  The Internet has evolved from those early days, although it still 
  retains the influence of its cultural origins. For instance, when 
  advertising first appeared on the Internet, it was regarded as some 
  sort of perversion. At that time, making money from the Internet was 
  still thought 
  of as wrong. This has changed, but unsolicited commercial email,
  known as spam, is still regarded as offensive to many people (and 
  hopefully it will remain an 
  unsanctioned use of the Internet for many more years.)
  <P>

  Regardless of the Internet culture, violations of copyright would 
  still occur on the Internet. This is for the simple reason 
  that to effectively restrict copyright, the restrictions must be 
  policeable and enforceable. The Internet is a loosely controlled 
  network, widely distributed over many varying legal environments. 
  This combination
  dashes any hope of either global policing or global 
  enforcement. The only real alternative is that people will choose not 
  to violate copyright restrictions, and this is not likely to happen,
  as we have seen,
  due to the personal benefits of copies and the lack of any 
  strong moral incentive to restrict copying. 
  <P>

  The simple act of browsing the web causes the web browser to create 
  copies of material, without asking anyone's permission. The web is a
  special case too, as sometimes copying apparently happens, but 
  really doesn't. This happens when a web page on one server contains 
  a link to content on another server, eg. an image. When the page 
  is rendered, that content is seamlessly rendered as well, making it 
  appear as if the other server's content had been copied onto the 
  first server, when in fact it was the web browser simply doing its 
  normal copying activity. It is not clear yet whether this sort of 
  thing is legal or not.
  <P>

  One response to the growth in copying of images on the Internet has 
  been the corresponding growth in watermarking. This is a 
<A HREF="http://www.signafy.com">technology</A> 
  that allows a `digital signature' to be invisibly written into the 
  image in a way that will be permanent, even though the image may be 
  rescaled or slightly altered. If a watermarked image is discovered, 
  then it can be immediately identified as a copy of the original,
  `unsigned' image. This is a clever technology, and it indicates that 
  people are reacting to the need for policing copying, but it only 
  works on certain unencrypted images, and it doesn't solve the problem of 
  enforcement.
  <P>

  To highlight this problem, let's look at the fictional country of 
  Photocopia. Photocopia is part of the global communications network, 
  including the 
  Internet, but is not a signatory of any global copyright treaty. Mr 
  Earnest Dodge sets up an Internet site that contains a whole stack 
  of copyright material, pulled straight off the Internet, and sells 
  it for one dollar a megabyte. Any subscriber can point their web 
  browser at this site and get the content. It seems that the copying 
  that happens as part of using a web browser is considered `fair use', 
  so the guilty party here is Mr Dodge. However, because he is based in 
  Photocopia, there is no way that the copyright restrictions can be enforced.
  <P>

  Mr Dodge might not charge for his site. Perhaps he aggregates a lot 
  of content and sells advertising on it, replacing any advertising 
  that was on the initial content (and presumably paying for the 
  development of that content). Perhaps he doesn't actually store the 
  content himself, and simply puts up links that go directly to the 
  content that he's aggregating. This latter model is the way that 
  the very 
<A HREF="http://www.it.fairfax.com.au/990216/industry/it1.html">successful site</A>
  Slashdot works.
  <P>

  These sort of models can be successful because the Internet is a new 
  form of distribution, one that is not controlled by any media empire. 
  As we saw before, the media empires control the traditional distribution 
  network, and it would be enormously expensive for a competitor to 
  emerge and compete with them by creating a duplicate one. The empires
  protect themselves by owning the copyright and hence forcing those 
  that want the a particular work to get it from that media empire. Now 
  the Internet can be used to distribute works. An alternative now 
  exists to using media empires for distribution.
  <P>

  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <H2><A NAME="internet_models">Internet Models</A></H2>

  I want to make something quite clear. I am not advocating the 
  destruction of the existing media empires. I am not suggesting that we 
  all go out and violate copyright. If you thought that these were my 
  intentions, then I could understand, as there are currently strong 
  feelings like these on the Internet today. However, I am trying 
  to show that violations of copyright are now part of our culture, 
  particularly on the Internet, and that those who work in businesses 
  that depend on 
  protection of works via copyright should 
  consider this carefully and take it into account in their business models. 
  In fact, as David Niemi 
<A HREF="http://www.tux.org/~niemi/opensource/developer-motivation.html">points out</A>,
  it is not even necessary to violate copyright in some cases to lose 
  what you were trying to protect, good software can always be 
  re-written by good programmers, given enough resources.
  <P>

  Some may think that there cannot be any successful business model 
  that deals with intellectual work on the Internet. That is not true, 
  and by looking at some of the activities on the present-day Internet, 
  we can piece together some possible Internet-proof business models.
  <P>

  Shareware is the busking of the Internet, and is the single most
  successful software business model for independent authors. Although,
  it does depend on how you define 
`<A HREF="http://www.opendoor.com/Rick/ShareSuccess/Shareware1.html">successful</A>'.
  Many
  authors write shareware as a hobby, spend very little money
  distributing or marketing it, then sit back and receive money 
  from the users of the shareware. When a user of shareware pays for
  the software, it is known as registration. Copying is <I>actively 
  encouraged</I> by the authors of shareware, since each new user of
  the software is another potential registrant.
  <P>

  Most shareware relies on the honesty of the users. Figures
<A HREF="http://www.asp-shareware.org/1-faq.asp">quoted</A>
  by the Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP) are that between 2% and
  50% of users register. 
<A NAME="saucs"></A>
  A 1994 shareware survey
<A HREF="http://mirror.apple.com/mirrors/Info-Mac.Archive/_Information/sft/shareware-case-study.txt">estimated</A>
  that between 5% to 10% of users of professional quality shareware register. 
  <P>

<A NAME="messitt_test"></A>
  However, if the
  shareware author doesn't rely on the honesty of the users, but
  implements a crippled product that is repaired when registration
  occurs, then an order of magnitude more users register. This is what
  Colin Messitt 
<A HREF="http://web.hackvan.com/pub/stig/articles/why-do-people-register-shareware.html">discovered</A>
  when he performed a large scale experiment. From this, it is pretty 
  clear that over 80% of users will copy software and not pay for it
  if given the chance. However, due to the large number of users exposed
  to the software by allowing copies to be readily distributed,
  shareware generates surprising revenue. For example, Colin's
  experiment earned him over US$30,000 in one year.
  <P>

  Project Gutenberg 
<A HREF="http://promo.net/pg/history.html">was started</A>
  by Michael Hart in 1971 in order to make a large number of important, 
  out-of-copyright, written works available to the population at large. 
  This was done by storing everything from <I>The Bible</I> to <I>Alice 
  In Wonderland</I> in simple text files, and placing them on bulletin 
  boards and web sites. Volunteers offer their time and their flat-bed 
  scanners to the project, and the library has continued to grow to 
  around 2,000 works. 
  <P>

  Strictly, it isn't a business, and hence doesn't have a business
  model. However, what it does may be copied by others, and they
  may all be competitors to your business.
  The project talks about "replicator technology" 
  where a single electronic copy can be replicated as many times as is 
  desired. Hence each electronic book is immediately free to anyone who 
  cares to read it - the act of experiencing that book is parallelisable. 
  <P>

  The products that Project Gutenberg produces are not charged for. 
  Basically, the books are given away for free. Project Gutenberg is 
  not a profit-making exercise, but they don't seem to care if the 
  mechanism that is used to get at the free books is being charged for.
  In this case, someone (the ISP) is offering the service of getting 
  access to literature, just like a bookstore. Although in this case, 
  the customer who gets the book pays for the service, but not for the 
  product.
  <P>

  A more recent phenomenon than the spread of free books is the spread 
  of free music, stored in the MP3 format. The format itself is widely 
  popular, challenging the traditional WAV and RealAudio formats - even 
  CNN is 
<A HREF="http://cnn.com/books/news/9902/22/mispronunciation/">using it</A>
  on its site. However its most famous, or infamous use, is to 
  distribute popular music. Sites such as 
<A HREF="http://www.mp3.com">MP3.com</A>
  allow musicians to 
  place their music for free, for people to download it for free, and 
  advertising pays for it. Musicians get free exposure, increasing 
  consumer awareness, and the possibility of offers of tours and 
  other gigs. Sites such as 
<A HREF="http://www.goodnoise.com/">Goodnoise</A>
  select the music that is available 
  on their site, giving some of it away for free, and selling some 
  of it for around US$1 per track. There are also many pirate tunes 
  available on the Internet in MP3 form at `leech sites', many which can 
  be found via a search engine written to locate MP3s, such as 
<A HREF="http://mp3.lycos.com/">Lycos</A>.
  <P>

  In the case of MP3s, very few sites are charging money for the download 
  of music. Given the availability of free pirated music, competitive 
  pressures are going to be influential here. Since no site can compete 
  with free product, few do. Goodnoise sells very cheap product, but they 
  also sell advertising, and no doubt sell the opportunity to retail 
  music through them. They sell very cheap product and make money selling 
  services.
  <P>

  The Open Source movement has risen to some prominence with the 
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/history.html">enormous growth</A>
  of the Linux operating system software, and the number of `respectable'
  organisations using open source software as part of their business.
  The Internet itself is built upon software developed as part of open 
  source-like development practises, which have their roots in 
  academia and the peer-review process. Software written under open 
  source arrangements contains a licensing agreement that places unique 
  copyright restrictions upon the user. Source code for the software 
  must be made available, and any changes to the source code must also be 
  made available. This restriction actually prevents the software from 
  ever being restricted to a closed group - such as those who pay a 
  price for it.
  Several thriving businesses have appeared in the open source scene. 
  These include companies like Red Hat and Cygnus who 
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/for-suits.html">sell the service</A>
  of distribution and support of the free product Linux.
  <P>

  In these Internet examples we have seen the shareware concept, 
  project Gutenberg, MP3 distribution, and open source software. They
  all involve the spread of copies of intellectual objects, but there
  are two themes that emerge from these examples. The theme from
  shareware is that each copy provides another chance to gain a
  registration, and the more copies that exist, the more potential
  registrations. This model is discussed in the 
<A HREF="copyright.html#exploit_the_opportunity">next section</A>.
  In the other successful examples, the products are given away 
  for little or nothing, but the associated services are charged for.
  This model is discussed in the section titled
<A HREF="copyright.html#exploit_the_relationship">Exploit the Relationship</A>.
  Together these models appear to cover the successful, emerging
  businesses on the Internet. It was inevitable that successful models
  such as these would appear once the Internet appeared in a society
  with a copying culture.
  <P>

  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <H2><A NAME="exploit_the_opportunity">Exploit the Opportunity</A></H2>

  When a person receives a copy of a product for the first time, this
  provides an opportunity for the person who created the product to
  generate income, but only if they were prepared to exploit it.
  Shareware works because it exploits this opportunity - the product
  displays messages asking the user to register, it may tell the user
  about other products by the same author, it can demonstrate the
  benefits of registering without providing all the benefits of
  registering. In essence, the shareware product is a small marketing
  machine that strives to convince every person that uses it that they
  should send the creator money.
  <P>

  Shareware is not used only for distributing people's dinky home software
  creations, but there are many big name software programmes that have
  used the shareware distribution method. Here is a small list of
  shareware examples:
  <UL>
    <LI><A HREF="http://www.pkware.com/">PKWARE's PK Zip</A></LI>
    <LI><A HREF="http://www.winzip.com/">Niko Mak's Win Zip</A></LI>
    <LI><A HREF="http://www.idsoftware.com/">id Software's Doom</A></LI>
    <LI><A HREF="http://www.mcafee.com/">McAfee's VirusScan</A></LI>
    <LI><A HREF="http://www.sausage.com/">Sausage Software's Hot Dog</A></LI>
    <LI><A HREF="http://www.stairways.com/">Stairways Software's Anarchie</A></LI>
  </UL>
  <P>

  The shareware concept is chiefly used by small operators who do not
  have the resources to run large 
<A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/shareware-faq/programmer/faq.html">marketing</A>
  campaigns. Given this, it makes a
  great deal of sense to allow other people to pay for the production
  of copies of the single thing that they are using to market their work
  - that work itself. The social communication networks that exist
  between people facilitates the spread of the software as people who
  appreciate the shareware pass copies onto others that they know. On
  the Internet these communication networks are particularly powerful as
  they may be spread very far and between very large numbers of people.
  <P>

  There are two prominant strategies for distributing shareware. The
  first strategy (Strategy #1) is to have public and private versions of 
  the software, and
  sell the means for turning a public version into a more enhanced
  private version. The second strategy (Strategy #2) is to distribute 
  only one version
  of the software, and rely only on the honesty of users to pay for
  the software when they make use of it. Each of these strategies is
  most successful when used to distribute a particular type of 
  software product.
  <P>

  We mentioned Geoffrey Moore above, when talking about a whole product.
  Another important concept that he advocates is changing your products
  and altering your marketing techniques when you "cross the chasm".
  Marketers see the population divided into different groups depending
  on likelihood of buying a product: innovators, early adopters, early
  majority, late majority, and the laggards. The majority of the
  population is in the early and late majorities, and Moore's chasm 
  occurs between the early adopters and the early majority. The theory
  that a different type of marketing and product is required to reach
  the majority of your market may explain the varied success of the two
  types of shareware strategy.
  <P>

  Strategy #1 seems to be more successful in the early adopters market.
  These people are willing to put up with a reasonable amount of hassle
  to get the benefits from a product. This is consistent with the idea
  of having to register before the product performs to its full
  potential. Very few of the really big name shareware products use this
  strategy, although it has been known to work, as in Messitt's test
  described 
<A HREF="copyright.html#messitt_test">above</A>.
  <P>

  Strategy #2 appeals to the mass market, since once they have decided
  to use the product, they only need to send out a cheque - the product
  already works. The ASP 
<A HREF="http://www.asp-shareware.org/memberstandards.asp">frowns</A>
  on the type of crippling used in Messitt's test, and has pointed out
  that shareware products that have become the "standard of industry" 
  use no crippling and few nagging reminders. The reduced percentage of
  registrations that no doubt result from less stringent enforcement of
  the shareware licences is easily made up by the far greater number of
  potential users in the mass market than in the early adopters.
  <P>

  Shareware is the busking of the Internet, and the strategies for
  successful busking are applicable with shareware distribution. 
  Bob Yuncken has described the three main busking rules as: 
  <UL>
    <LI> present to as many people as possible, </LI>
    <LI> impress them as much as possible, and </LI>
    <LI> guilt them into paying. </LI>
  </UL>
  Addionally, an 
<A HREF="http://www.fooledya.com/busking/">article</A>
  on balloon juggling by Larry Moss emphasises the need for 
  <UL>
    <LI> projecting an appropriate personality, and </LI>
    <LI> presenting the reminder to pay in a suitable way. </LI>
  </UL>
  These points are confirmed in the findings of the 1994 Shareware
  Author and User Case Study, mentioned
<A HREF="copyright.html#saucs">above</A>.
  In particular, if a user thought that the author was a helpful type,
  or was writing the code to support his kids, etc. then that user was
  more likely to register. This importance of projecting the appropriate
  personality demonstrates how branding concepts carry over into
  shareware too.
  <P>

  The business model of exploiting the opportunity is not restricted
  to software. An example of how social communication networks were
  exploited and a product used newly encounted people as opportunities
  is the example of 
<A HREF="http://www.hotmail.com">Hotmail</A>.
  Hotmail is a web-based email system, that attaches a little sentence
  at the end of every email that it sends out, mentioning itself.
  Recipients of email from Hotmail find out how good the system is
  because they've received email from someone via Hotmail. New
  recipients then become Hotmail subscribers by paying for an account in
  the form of information about themselves. If you don't think that 
  personal information is valuable, then just think how willing you
  would be to give details of your suburb, age, and occupation to
  a complete stranger.
  <P>

  Hotmail encourages people to send out little advertisements for
  Hotmail to all their friends and associates, just like shareware.
  Similarly, potential Hotmail users are assured of the ability of
  Hotmail before they buy, just like with shareware. Hotmail has become
  the single largest email system, and is the dominant player in
  countries that they have never spent a cent marketing in. The Business
  2.0 magazine 
<A HREF="http://www.business2.com/articles/issue1sept.html">reports</A>
  that now Hotmail attracts more than 100,000 new sign-ups per <I>day</I>.
  <P>

  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <H2><A NAME="exploit_the_relationship">Exploit the Relationship</A></H2>

  Once a copy of an intellectual object is obtained via digital
  means, there is no further need to obtain copies of that object, 
  since perfect copies can be produced by anyone. Given that our culture
  is becoming one where making copies is a mundane activity, and the
  Internet makes it hard to know who is making copies of what, basing a
  business on selling intellectual products is a risky proposition. A
  parasitic business might appear, using your products, and selling them
  cheaper, or giving them away for free. How can a business expect to
  survive against these competitors?
  A more robust alternative is to base the business on selling services,
  since there are certain kinds of services that can't be copied by a
  parasitic competitor.
  <P>

  Often the service provided is the distribution of the product, which
  may not be a compelling service when the product can be copied by anyone.
  However, there are types of distribution service that are 
  obviously resistant to this. These types are those that make certain
  guarantees about the service that are hard for others to duplicate
  without using (and paying for) the service themselves.
  The two most obvious of these are the distribution of
  time-sensitive information, and the distribution of personalised
  information. Another less obvious example is the distribution of
  information using environmentally sensative network providers.
  <P>

  The
<A HREF="http://www.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</A>
  (WSJ) is one of the few big-name sites that charges for providing
  subscription content. This content includes information not available
  from the free WSJ site. It could be significant that very few other
  papers provide subscriptions at a charge. Perhaps in general the
  subscriptions aren't personalised enough, or perhaps a site needs to
  be a very large player before it can afford to charge for information
  that can be easily copied. In any case, charging for 
  subscriptions to online information services is rare.
  <P>

  It could be the case that consumers do not really understand or
  appreciate a model where they get product for free, and yet they pay
  for an associated service. This is interesting, since in many cases
  the service is more desirable than the product that the service is
  based around. Maybe in general it will take a while for customers 
  to understand
  this business model, but this is the very model that is being used to
  sell open source software. In this case, there have been very clear
  successes. Customer understanding must be spreading.
  <P>

  One question concerning this model is why would anyone produce product
  if they knew that it was being given away? In the case of open source,
  the people who produce the product aren't even receiving income from
  the associated services. Eric S. Raymond makes a
<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">good case</A>
  for the theory that people will produce product for increased 
  reputation alone. For example, one possible benefit of a good reputation 
  is that it leads to future material gains in the form of interesting
  and well-paid job offers.
  <P>

  However, there are some businesses that fence sit on the issue of
  selling services not products. O'Reilly and 
  Associates sell the development 
<A HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pperl2/">books and tools</A>
  for the free utility Perl. The production and distribution of books 
  and software tools are services to the developer that keep them up-to-date.
  Since books and tools are products as well, this makes them vulnerable
  to the weakness that we have previously identified. Perhaps O'Reilly
  should look at how they might be able to restructure their operations
  concerning Perl to avoid this weakness. However, traditional
  distribution methods are used to distribute these products, so they
  are not yet under threat by the Internet.
  <P>

  Another fence sitter is Goodnoise.
  Although Goodnoise was one of the Internet examples listed above, it 
  doesn't closely follow the recommendation to charge for services and
  give away products. As a final example, 
  let's develop a new business model for it, based on the above analysis.
  <P>

  At the moment, Goodnoise does not charge its downloaders for the 
  service that it provides, instead it charges them for the music,
  which are products. Goodnoise does charge advertisers and music
  labels for services, but the exception for downloaders appears to be a
  particular weakness. Instead of charging US$1 for each track downloaded,
  it could charge for the service of collecting and providing lists of 
  music that are personally tailored to subscribers of the service. For 
  example, for a charge of US$10, I might be able to download up to 5 
  hours of music from the site, receive lists of music at the site that 
  I would be personally interested in, know that the operators of the 
  site will be seeking out music that I'd like to listen to, send 
  questions to the musicians who play my favourite music, and submit 
  fan artwork or reviews that are then displayed on the site. These 
  services would all cost money for Goodnoise to provide, but because 
  they are charging for them, they can't lose.
  <P>

  The lesson for Goodnoise is that allowing music to be downloaded 
  is cheap to provide, anyone can do it, and due to the copying culture 
  and the Internet, anyone does. Some businesses follow the Exploit the
  opportunity model and benefit from large numbers of copies being
  made, but many businesses do not.
  To make these online media business 
  `Internet-proof', achieving profits cannot be based on the 
  uncertain sales of a duplicable product.
  <P>

  <!------------------------------------------------------------------>
  <H2><A NAME="conclusions">Conclusions</A></H2>

  Control of copyright restrictions is a critical part of the business 
  model of the distributors of intellectual work, such as media empires. 
  However, copyright has always been inadequate, and legislators have 
  been pressured to extend it. A business based on copyright has a 
  potential <I>Achilles heel</I>.
  <P>

  Due to the increase in technology, copying has become extremely easy 
  to do. Copying is now a normal part of our society, and copyright 
  violations of intellectual works are regular occurrences. 
  Violators do not usually feel bad about their violations, and engage
  in the act of copying routinely.
  <P>

  Media empires often earn large revenues from sales of their products, 
  although they incur hefty
  expenses in related services which are at no additional charge. In a 
  situation where copyright cannot be restricted, the business may not 
  be viable.
  <P>

  The Internet is a case where copyright cannot be restricted, due to 
  its global presence and cultural basis. For example, a direct competitor
  may operate from a region where copyright is not respected nor
  enforced. Businesses that attempt to incorporate the Internet into 
  their business model should be prepared to cope with this.
  <P>

  Two models were proposed that addressed the problem of endemic
  copyright infringement on the Internet. These were the models of
  `exploit the opportunity' and `exploit the relationship'. The former
  model uses each copy of a product as a marketing device that can be
  exploited. The latter model involves charging for services associated
  with a product. Of course, these models can be combined, and there may
  be other models that do not have a dependence on charging for copyable
  products.
  <P>

  Without the adoption of a business model such as these, an online
  media business cannot be considered `Internet-proof', and may fall 
  victim to reduced sales of a duplicable product.
